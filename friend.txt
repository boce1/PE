Making function or class friend will allow to access private and protected members of that function
without getters and setters.

Note: Method of class cant be friend function to another class
        only class itself can be friend to another class

Example for friend function:
Overriding output operator in operator_over.cpp is example of friend function

Example for friend class:
#include <iostream>

class B;

class A {
    private:
        int x;
    public:
        A(int x) : x(x) {}
    friend class B;
};

class B {
    public:
        int getA_x(const A& a) const {
            return a.x;
        }
};

int main()
{
    A a1(10);
    B b1;
    std::cout << b1.getA_x(a1);
    return 0;
}

Output: 
10
